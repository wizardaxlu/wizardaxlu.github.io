        <u>Facts about the heart </u>
    </h1>
    
        <p>The heart is a vital organ of your body. It pumps blood around the body to help all of the other organs do their jobs. The heart has 4 chambers. Two chambers circulate blood to and from the lungs. Two other chambers circulate blood to and from the rest of the body. It is the most important organ in your body. It helps to take oxygen from your lungs to all the other parts of your body. When you run your body needs more oxygen and so you breathe faster and your heart beats faster.</p>
        <p>Your heart beats because of tiny eletrical signals that move through the heart in a wave from the top to the bottom. The heart is a big muscle. If your heart doesn't work properly sometimes it can be helped with a pacemaker. This is a machine that sends the right electrical signals to the heart through wires. The battery lasts for 10 years.</p>
